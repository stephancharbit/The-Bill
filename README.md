# Pre-work - *The Bill*

The Bill is a tip calculator application for iOS.

Submitted by: **Stephan Charbit**

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:
* [X] User can enter a bill amount, choose a tip percentage, and see the tip and total values.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [X] Custom font
* [X] UI animations
* [X] Making sure the keyboard is always visible and the bill amount is always the first responder. This way the user doesn't have to tap anywhere to use this app. Just launch the app and start typing.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [X] Changed the segment control labels to reflect quality of service rather than a number
– [X] Changed the UI color to show a progressively brighter UI based on tip amount
– [X] Added animations to reward larger tip amounts :-)

## Video Walkthrough 

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:

## Notes
– I experienced ome UI weirdness in Xcode when I updated to the Mac OS Sierra Beta.
– I was forced to update to a new version of Swift with Xcode 8, but looks like this went OK

Due to time constraints I abandoned the following features:
– A ‘Settings’ screen that would allow the user to change the color of the UI
– A link that would display a modal asking the user to donate the tip amount to a hunger charity using a query string URL (eg. - https://act.stophungernow.org/checkout/donation?eid=67270&amount=15.00)
